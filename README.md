The Odin Project's Landing Page Project under Foundations course section.

This is my attempt solve the project.

#After Completing the Project

I'm surprised I could do this well.
I didn't think there would be much less frustration when I'm working on this project
I think most advices on the course thus far really helped me to shape my own thinking pattern
and it really helped me when I got stuck on something.
I hope you who viewed this could achieve what you want to achieve.
Good luck!
